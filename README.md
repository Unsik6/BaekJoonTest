# Problem Solving in C++

This repository contains source codes of the solutions of the problems provided by [BAEKJOON ONLINE JUDGE](https://www.acmicpc.net/).
BAEKJOON ONLINE JUDGE provides a lot of good problems including the problems featured in prominent domestic and international competitions.
The source codes are written using C++, and each file contains the summarization of constraints of input and output of each problem.
Note that few solutions - actually one problem(25207) - are not working because I am trying to solve the problems.
And, I tried to solve some problems in this repository in diverse manner, so there are multiple solution files of one problem in this repository.

The solutions in this repository are solved using diverse algorithms and methods. The _type_ is defined as the category of BAEKJOON ONLINE JUDGE, and a problem can has multiple types.
Note that some categories of BAEKJOON ONLINE JUDGE don't be used as type, because the unused categories are a subset of other categories.
For example, Primality Test, Sieve Of Eratosthenes, (Extended) Euclidean Algorithm, etc belong to Number Theory.
As mentioned eariler, there are the solution to well-known problems such as _Longest Common Subsequence_, _Edit Distance_, _Activity Selection Problems_ even if they ar enot explisitly specified by type.

This PS project is usefull, since it can improve the insight of algorithms.
Additionally, some solutions in this repository have been used as a notes for tutoring undergraduates.
